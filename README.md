## ✅ **Key Highlights**

* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns and feature relationships.
* Detected and treated **outliers** using the IQR method.
* Addressed **class imbalance** using **SMOTE**.
* Built and compared **classification models**:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
* Evaluated models using **F1 Score** and **ROC-AUC**.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 **Results**

* Achieved good performance on majority class.
* Challenges remain in improving minority class predictions.
* Potential for improvement with advanced feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**

* Advanced feature engineering.
* More aggressive hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV).
* Adding model explainability (e.g., SHAP values).
